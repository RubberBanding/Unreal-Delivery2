# I Am Legend
A long time ago, a plague killed most of the humans on planet Earth. Those who died, ended up becoming monsters, brainless undead creatures who only followed their instincts. Now, Robert Neville, a US Army virologist, alone with his loyal dog, struggles to survive in a desolate and post-apocalyptic New York.

This is a survival FPS that also features stealth design components. Don't make any noise or the zombies will tear you apart!
